## 📌 How It Works

1. **User enters a task** in the input field and clicks the **Add** button.
2. The task is **added to the list** and displayed dynamically.
3. Clicking on a task toggles the `checked` class:
   - Adds `line-through` style
   - Changes the SVG circle icon (from empty to checked).
4. Clicking the ❌ icon (a span element) **removes** that task.
5. Tasks are handled using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
